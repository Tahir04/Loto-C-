# Loto Game

This is a simple console-based game where two players take turns trying to find and replace numbers in a 2D array. The game continues until one player wins by finding and replacing all numbers or all numbers have been attempted.

## How to Play

1. The program will prompt each player to enter their name.
2. A random number between 1 and 90 will be generated.
3. The program checks if the number has already been attempted. If it has, a new random number is generated.
4. The number is added to the game log and attempted to find and replace in each player's 2D array.
5. If a player successfully replaces all numbers in their 2D array with `0`, they win.
6. The game ends either when a player wins or all numbers have been attempted.
